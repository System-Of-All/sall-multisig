# Testing Strategy

Testing must cover:

- Threshold validation logic
- Invalid signature rejection
- Replay protection
- Adapter-level failures
- Cross-chain consistency



## Recommended Test Types

- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Fuzz testing
- Simulation testing
- Stress testing for high signer counts



## Security Testing

- Signature forgery attempts
- Unauthorized signer simulation
- Threshold bypass attempts
